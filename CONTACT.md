Our firm uses secure email and Signal with our clientele.
Current clients, family, and close friends get priority for all communications.
If you're interested in becoming a client, see our [*rate sheet*](https://derwen.ai/flywheel#rates) for details.

I hold monthly public office hours, as well as participating in many conferences, meetups, podcasts, and webinars. See our [*event calendar*](https://derwen.ai/events) for details.

For other community discussions, I am actively engaged in 
[Twitter public timeline](https://twitter.com/pacoid),
the ["Graph-Based Data Science" LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6725785/),
[GitHub issues for multiple open source projects](https://github.com/ceteri),
[StackOverflow Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/story/pacoid),
[Discourse Q&A](https://answers.knowledgegraph.tech/). Overall, that represents eleven available modes of communication, **really going out of the way**.

In addition, there are quasi-professional areas of communications, engaged on an "as-is" basis, which include several Slack boards, posts/comments on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceteri/), articles/comments on [Medium](https://medium.com/@pacoid), reviews/comments on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6544919.Paco_Nathan).

Otherwise, recognize that almost every social media platform promotes its own messaging systems, generally as borked alternatives to email, generally through aggressive means called "growth hacking" or worse.
At last count, there were **over a dozen** balkanized channels through which people attempt to engage me in allegedly professional communications.
The word "ultimatum" would probably be a more apt than "engage" in these cases. 
Many people even become indignant about not receiving prompt responses, as they've demanded.
To paraphrase the incomparable Verner Twertzhog: `Fuck off, you ignorant little shit; where is your pathetic god now?` You're welcome.

Hear me now, and believe me later: except for personal matters, if you persist in using any form of email or messaging *other* than what's listed above  ... go fuck yourself; **you are the problem**.
If you are a recruiter or sales rep who's been bombarding our firm with unsolicited email, calls, texts, messaging ... **go fuck yourself**; you are vile.
To be clear, any requests for shared calendar represent security violations, and our corporate counsel will likely pursue criminal charges against you as an individual.
Also, if you try to introduce me to people and scheduled a call without asking first, I'll probably come after you **with a goddam baseball bat**; you will deserve it. And you will like it, **or else**.
