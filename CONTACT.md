I work a lot within developer communities and tech events, and try to provide many pointers to learning materials, industry analysis, and so on, and connect with many people. 

That said, co-workers, co-authors, customers, channel partners, family, and close friends get priority for all communications.

For other community discussions, I am actively engaged on a
Bluesky public timeline [@pacoid.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/pacoid.bsky.social),
the ["Graph Data Science" LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6725785/),
[GitHub issues for multiple open source projects](https://github.com/ceteri),
and
[StackOverflow Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1698443/paco).

In addition, there are quasi-professional areas of communications, engaged on an "as-is" basis, which include several Slack boards, posts/comments on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceteri/), articles/comments on [Medium](https://medium.com/@pacoid), reviews/comments on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6544919.Paco_Nathan).

Anyone who asks "I just need 30 minutes of your time..." is an idiot. GTFO!

Moreover, if you're reaching out to me about recruiting, getting introductions in the Bay Area, seeking investments, finding a job, promoting your outsourcing team, finding a personal mentor, having someone evaluate a product, listening to you rant about "AGI", etc., GET REAL. I am not someone who can help you, I do not live anywhere near SF, nor am I a tour guide.

If you persist you'll only prove to people that we need to ignore you. You're welcome.
