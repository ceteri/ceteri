Our firm uses secure email and [Signal](https://signal.org/) with our clientele.
Current clients, family, and close friends get priority for all communications.
If you're interested in becoming a client, see our [*rate sheet*](https://derwen.ai/rates) for details.

For other community discussions, I am actively engaged in
[Mastodon public timeline](https://mastodon.green/@pacoid),
[Twitter public timeline](https://twitter.com/pacoid),
the ["Graph Data Science" LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6725785/),
[GitHub issues for multiple open source projects](https://github.com/ceteri),
and
[StackOverflow Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1698443/paco).

I participate in many conferences, meetups, podcasts, and webinars, and sometimes hold public office hours online.

In addition, there are quasi-professional areas of communications, engaged on an "as-is" basis, which include several Slack boards, posts/comments on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceteri/), articles/comments on [Medium](https://medium.com/@pacoid), reviews/comments on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6544919.Paco_Nathan).

Otherwise, recognize that almost every social media platform promotes its own messaging systems, generally as borked alternatives to email, generally through aggressive means called "growth hacking" or worse.
At last count, there were **over a dozen** other balkanized channels through which people attempt to engage me in allegedly professional communications.
The word "ultimatum" would perhaps be more apt than "engage" in these cases.
Some of these "people" have the audacity to become indignant about not receiving prompt responses, as they've demanded.

Hear me now, and believe me later: except for personal matters, if you use any form of email or messaging *other* than what's listed above ... **you are the problem**.
If you persist in doing so ... 
and especially if you happen to be a recruiter, sales rep, prospective investor, or secondary market broker who's been bombarding our firm with unsolicited email, calls, texts, messaging ... 
My grandmother will gleefully feed your entrails (after using them to scry) to our pet komodo dragons.

To paraphrase the incomparable Werner Herzog: "You will deserve it. And you will like it."
